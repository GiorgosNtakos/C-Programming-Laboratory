# C Programming Laboratory  
### Course: Computer Technology & Programming  
### Academic Year: 2017–2018 (1st Semester)

This repository contains my solutions for the three laboratory exercise sets of the  
course **Computer Technology and Programming**, where students learn the C language  
and procedural programming fundamentals.

The exercises cover:

- data types, operators and expressions  
- selection and repetition (if / switch / loops)  
- functions, arrays, pointers  
- structs and dynamic memory  
- file handling  
- simple algorithms and numerical computations

Below is a brief overview of each set.

## 📘 **Set 1 – C Fundamentals**  
*Based on the first exercise booklet* :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

Topics include:

- evaluation of expressions & operator precedence  
- printing numbers in columns  
- computing mathematical functions  
- type casting and precision  
- Euclidean distance computation  
- temperature conversion (F → C)  
- arithmetic operations, logarithms  
- quadratic equation roots  
- unit conversions (m → inch, € → GRD)  
- ASCII table printing  
- series computations using loops  
- digit reversal  
- simple ATM simulation  
- mobile billing calculation  
- Fibonacci sequence  
- sum of squares  
- maximum-sum pair detection  
- number digit duplication (AB → AABB)

## 📘 **Set 2 – Functions, Arrays, Pointers, Structs**  

Exercises include:

- Bubble Sort implementation  
- word length histogram from user input  
- simple word-guessing game  
- struct-based string table processing  
- cyclic character substitution cipher  
- substring position detection  
- Pascal triangle (2D array)  
- dynamic array allocation using malloc  
- summing rows of a dynamically allocated matrix  
- solving 3×3 linear systems  
- matrix multiplication using pointers  
- Sieve of Eratosthenes for prime numbers

## 📘 **Set 3 – Pointers, Structs & File Handling**  
*Based on the third exercise booklet* :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

Topics covered:

- bank account records stored in structs  
- student record processing  
- locating word occurrences between two strings  
- simple turn-based strategy simulation using structs  
- diff/patch implementation (file comparison & patch generation)
